# Stack-a-thon
This project was done during Fullstack Academy's version of a Hack-a-thon. We were given four days to put something together. Because of this, the code is not the most efficient or easy to read.

## Goal
I have seen many presentations and speeches where filler words like 'like', 'uhh', 'umm', 'you know', etc are used extensively. I myself am a culprit. I want to wanted to create an application that will help people try to improve themselves while also using an API I was not very familiar with.

### The FluffTrainer
The FluffTrainer is built for people training for a speech. Once you hit the start button, a timer will begin. Once it does, the application will begin to listen for specific phrases: "like", "you know", and "I mean". At five second intervals, if those phrases were heard, it will store it into the database for the user and display the phrase on the screen below. If there was a phrase that should not have counted as a bufferword, you can remove it from the database simply by hitting the close button to the left of the phrase.
